<p>This is an app created to help people compile a list of the groceries they wish to buy on their next trip to their local supermarket.</p>
<p>It is created using basic HTML and javascript. To run the app, all users need to do is open it (the HTML file) in a Web browser like Chrome or Firefox.</p> 
Users can enter their grocery items one-by-one and a running list is generated on-screen for them to view.
This is the first program/app project I have created as a student at Ivan-on-Tech Academy.
