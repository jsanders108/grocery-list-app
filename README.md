<p>This is an app created to help people compile a list of the groceries they wish to buy on their next trip to their local supermarket.</p>
<p>It is created using basic HTML and javascript. To run the app, the first thing you need to do is download the following files to the same folder on your computer: "grocery_list_app.html" and "Collage.jpg". Next, open it (the HTML file) in a Web browser like Chrome or Firefox.</p> 
<p>You can enter your grocery items one-by-one and a running list is generated on-screen for you to view. It is also possible to remove items from the list (and reset it) as needed.</p>
<p>This is the first program/app project I have created as a student at Ivan-on-Tech Academy.</p>
